# Task Description:

# Consider a commercial bank, Bank of Orange County, where anyone can open bank accounts. To open a bank account, the following information is needed - 

# Name 
# Address
# Social Security
# An initial deposit amount. 
# The bank assigns a unique ID whenever a user opens an account. The unique ID is incrementally assigned to new users, meaning if the last new userâ€™s ID is x, the user signing up will have a unique ID (x + 1). If a user closes their account, the unique ID can be re-claimed and re-assigned to future new users. 

# Now, write a class for the Bank of Orange County to complete the following tasks - 



# Task-1: Model the list of users as a linked list 
# where each account is a node in the list.
# Users must be sorted by their ID in the linked list.

    _currentIDNum = 0

        self.balance = balance
        self.id = Node._currentIDNum
