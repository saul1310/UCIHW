# Task Description: Complete the following tasks.

# Task-1:  Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.
#  In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

# Example 1:

# Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"

# Output: true

# Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").



# Task-2:  You are given a chess board (of 8×8 dimension), and there are 8 queens placed randomly on the board. Each of the 8 queens is in different columns, and that means no two queens are attacking each other vertically. But some queens are attacking each other horizontally and/or diagonally. You have to move the queens so that no two queens are attacking each other from any direction. You are allowed to move the queens vertically, and thus, you can only change the row positions of each queen and not the column. A move consists of moving a queen from (R1, C) to (R2, C) where 1 ≤ R1, R2 ≤ 8 and R1 ̸= R2. You have to find the minimum number of moves required to complete the task.

# Each input consists of a line containing 8 integers. All these integers will be in the range [1, 8]. The i-th integer indicates the row position of a queen in the i-th column.

# Example 1: 

# Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

# Output: 7

# Example 2:

# Input: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

# Output: 7

# Write sample test cases to validate your implementation.
